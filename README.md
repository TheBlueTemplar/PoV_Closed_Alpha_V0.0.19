# Path-of-the-Vatt-ghern-V0.0.11-Alpha

### There are two main "objectives" about this test:

Try making a Vatt'ghern with any origin other than my mod's, then take note of your experience of the entire process. Was it fun, was it balanced?

Play around with the Vatt'ghern (regardless of ho you obtained him). Does this feel broken op? does it feel 'earned'. Does it "fit" in the base game and Legends?

Also play around with the new events, and overall mechanics, including the Enemy Mutation System, do you like it? Is it balanced? Please do tell me!


### Installation:

Download the zip and place into your bb data folder (Do not extract)

Recommended Modlist:
* MSU
* Modern Hooks
* Latest Legends Version
* PoV, testing version

Of course, you can include some simple mods, ui mods and such, but please try to keep the list short for the best testing results. Also, I will not redistribute any of the aforementioned mods, you will need to dl them yourselves, though you should really have all of them already. I will upload my mod here too in the next days 

### Incompatible Mods:
Using Bredditor can cause millions of issues, keep this in mind!


### Information about the tests:
You can find everything related to the tests in the PoV discord server
